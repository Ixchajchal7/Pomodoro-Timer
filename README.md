Pomodoro Timer Application
This is a simple Pomodoro timer application that can help you stay focused on your tasks by breaking them down into manageable chunks and providing you with regular breaks.

How it works
Add tasks you want to work on by entering their names in the input field and submitting the form.
Once you have added tasks, you will see them listed on the screen, each with a start button.
Click the start button for a task to start the timer for that task.
The timer will count down from 25 minutes and display the time remaining on the screen.
Once the timer is complete, the task will be marked as completed and the timer will switch to a 5-minute break.
After the break, you can start another task timer.
Code Overview
The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The index.html file contains the basic structure of the page, while the style.css file contains the styling for the page. The main functionality of the application is provided by the app.js file, which contains the JavaScript code for adding tasks, starting timers, and handling timer events.

The code uses an array to store the tasks and a timer to keep track of the time remaining for each task. When a task timer is complete, the code marks the task as completed and switches to a break timer.

Getting Started
To use the application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can add tasks and start timers directly from the page.
